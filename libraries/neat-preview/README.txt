This is the preview release of NEAT support for Neuroph neural network framework.
NEAT stands for "Neural Evolution of Augmeted Topologies", it is a Genetic Algorithm 
for the evolution of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) developed by Ken Stanley. 
The NEAT support for Neuroph is developed and contributed by Aidan Morgan.
This release contains:

neuroph-core-2.3            Neuroph core libraru
neat-0.9                    NEAT support library
neat-experiment-robot-0.1   Maze experiment with NEAT library

Check out the neat-0.9\docs\overview.html for brief obverview on how to use this library.
