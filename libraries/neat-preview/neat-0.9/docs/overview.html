<h1>WHAT IS NEAT?</h1>

<p>
NEAT stands for "Neural Evolution of Augmeted Topologies", it is a
Genetic Algorithm for the evolution of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
developed by Ken Stanley. 
</p>
<p>Conventionally, neural network topology is
chosen by a human experimenter, and a genetic algorithm is used to
select effective connection weights. The topology of such a network
stays constant throughout this weight selection process. <br><br>The NEAT
approach begins with a perceptron-like feed-forward network of only
input and output neurons. As evolution progresses, the topology of the
network may be augmented by either adding a neuron along an existing
connection, or by adding a new connection between previously unconnected
neurons. </p>
<p>
More details about NEAT can be found in Ken Stanley's original
NEAT paper located at:
http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf <br><br>The Neuroph
implementation of NEAT (NEAT-Contrib) aims to recreate the same
algorithm as defined by Ken Stanley using the Neuroph library as the
Neural Network implementation. The design of NEAT-Contrib is influenced
by another implementation of NEAT, ANJI (anji.sourceforge.net), but aims
to remain true to the original Stanley implementation of NEAT.
</p>
<h1>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h1>
<p>
NEAT follows a similar approach to other genetic algorithms, the only difference being that a Chromosome 
(in NEAT-Contrib kown as an <code>Organism</code>) contains either <code>ConnectionGene</code> or <code>NeuronGene</code>s.
</p>
<p>The evolution process works follwing this psueudo code:</p>
<pre>
	WHILE THE EXIT CRITERIA IS NOT MET
		DETERMINE FITNESS FOR CURRENT GENERATION
		SELECT ORGANISMS FOR NEXT GENERATION
		REPRODUCE ORGANISMS UNTIL POPULATION SIZE IS MET
		MUTATE ORGANISMS
	END-WHILE
</pre>

<p>The basic loop construct is implemented by the <code>org.neuroph.contrib.neat.gen.Evolver</code> class.</p>

<p>Each step of the above pseudo-code corresponds to a seperate interface in NEAT-Contrib:</p>
<h3>Selection</h3>
<p>Selection is provided via the <code>org.neuroph.contrib.neat.gen.operations.OrganismSelector</code> interface. NEAT-Contrib
provides one organism selector.</p>
<h4>org.neuroph.contrib.neat.gen.operations.selector.NaturalSelectionOrganismSelector</h4>
<p  class="indented">
The Natural Selection selector works by ensuring that the most "fit" <code>Organism</code> in each <code>Specie</code> is
preserved between generations (if elitism is turned on). It then will continue to select from the remaining <code>Organism</code>s
in order of fitness until the <code>survivalRatio</code> has been met. </p>  

<h3>Reproduction</h3>
<p>
Reproduction is implemented in subclasses of <code>org.neuroph.contrib.neat.gen.operations.ReproductionOperator</code>.
NEAT-Contrib provides two implementations of the <code>ReproductionOperator</code> as used in the Stanley-NEAT implementation:</p>
<h4>org.neuroph.contrib.neat.gen.operations.reproduction.CrossoverReproductionOperator</h4>
<p class="indented">This reprodction operator will select two "parent" <code>Organism</code>s at random and then create a new "offspring" by
randomly splicing the parent <code>Organism</code>s gene's together.</p>

<h4>org.neuroph.contrib.neat.gen.operations.reproduction.CloneReproductionOperator</h4>
<p class="indented">This reproduction operator will select a "parent" <code>Organism</code> at random and create an exact copy of it.</p>  
<h3>Mutation</h3>
<p>Mutation is implemented in sublclasses of <code>org.neuroph.contrib.neat.gen.operations.MutationOperator</code> and is 
where the bulk of the interesting work of NEAT is performed.</p> 

<p>Each mutation operation is assigned a <code>mutationProbability</code>
that will determine how frequently the mutation is performed. These values are initialised to the default values used in
Stanley-NEAT, however they can be modified to suit a specific experiment's needs.</p>

<h4>org.neuroph.contrib.neat.gen.operations.mutation.AddConnectionMutationOperation</h4>
<p class="indented">The add connection operation will randomly select two <code>NeuronGene</code>s and create a connection between them
(as long as no connection already exists, and the two neuron's are not input or output neurons).</p>  		

<h4>org.neuroph.contrib.neat.gen.operations.mutation.AddNeuronMutationOperation</h4>
<p class="indented">The add neuron operation will randomly select a <code>ConnectionGene</code> in the <code>Organism</code> and split it 
into two connections, inserting a new <code>NeuronGene</code> in-between.</p> 

<h4>org.neuroph.contrib.neat.gen.operations.mutation.WeightMutationOperation</h4>
<p class="indented">The weight mutation operation will randomly select a <code>ConnectionGene</code> and adjust it's weight.</p>
<h1>CREATING AN EXPERIMENT IN NEAT-Contrib</h1>

<h3>FitnessFunction</h3>
To create a basic experiment in NEAT-Contrib a developer needs to design
a suitable fitness function for evaluating the "fitness" of a particular
ANN. This fitness function is provided to NEAT-Contrib by implementing
the <br><br><code>org.neuroph.contrib.neat.gen.operations.FitnessFunction</code> interface.

<br><br>This interface defines one method:
<br><br><code>public void evaluate(List &lt;OrganismFitnessScore&gt; fitnesses)</code>
. <br><br>To implement the evaluate method the developer must compute the
"fitness" score for each of the OrganismFitnessScore's provided. <br><br>For
example:
<br><pre><code> 
public void evaluate(List&lt;OrganismFitnessScore&gt; fitnesses) { 
	for(OrganismFitnessScore ofs : fitnesses) { 
		Organism o = ofs.getOrganism(); 
		NeuralNetwork net = ofs.getNeuralNetwork(); 
		double fitness = calculateNetworkFitness(net);

		ofs.setFitness(fitness); 
	}
 } 
</code></pre>
 
The above code sample shows in the simplest form a Fitness Function can be defined. It is important to remember to set
the fitness score on the <code>OrganismFitnessScore</code> to make sure that this value is used for evaluation in the next 
generation.

<h3>NeatParameters</h3>
Once a suitable <code>FitnessFunction</code> has been defined the developer needs to define the environment in which
the evolutionary process is to be performed. This is typically done by providing an implementation of the 
<code>org.neuroph.contrib.neat.gen.NeatParameters</code> interface.

<br><br>For most usages the <code>org.neuroph.contrib.neat.gen.impl.SimpleNeatParameters</code> will suffice.
<br><br>For example:
<code>
<pre>
		SimpleNeatParameters params = new SimpleNeatParameters();
		params.setFitnessFunction(new ExampleFitnessFunction());
		params.setPopulationSize(150);
		params.setMaximumFitness(1000);
		params.setMaximumGenerations(100);
</pre>
</code>
<br>The code sample above shows the basic configuration of a <code>SimpleNeatParameters</code> instance. The developer must
specify a population size and the fitness function at a minimum. It is recommended that a <code>maximum fitness</code> or
<code>maximum generations</code> is specified to ensure that the evolutionary process has a termination condition.

<br><br>Alternatively you can implement the <code>org.neuroph.contrib.neat.gen.NeatParameters</code> interface  
(or extend <code>SimpleNeatParameters</code>) yourself and write a custom handler for the 
<code>public boolean exitCriteriaMet(int generationNumber, double bestFitness)</code> that captures your exit criteria.

<h3>Evolver</h3>
The last step involved in using NEAT-Contrib is to create a <code>org.neuroph.contrib.neat.gen.Evolver</code> and define the 
initial network layout you wish to use.

<br><br>The constructor for the Evolver requires an instance of <code>NeatParameters</code> and the input and output
<code>NeuronGene</code>s you wish to use.
<br><br><code>public Evolver(NeatParameters params, List&lt;NeuronGene&gt; inputLayer, List&lt;NeuronGene&gt; outputLayer)</code>
<br><br>For example:
<br><br>
<code><pre>
		NeuronGene inputOne = new NeuronGene(NeuronType.INPUT, params);
		NeuronGene inputTwo = new NeuronGene(NeuronType.INPUT, params);
		NeuronGene output = new NeuronGene(NeuronType.OUTPUT, params);
		
		Evolver e = Evolver.createNew(params, Arrays.asList(inputOne, inputTwo), Arrays.asList(output));
		Organism best = e.evolve();
</pre></code>
<br><br>
With an <code>Evolver</code> defined it is a simple matter of calling the <code>evolve()</code> method which will terminate
when the <code>exitCriteriaMet</code> of the <code>NeatParameters</code> returns true. Upon completion the <code>evolve()</code> 
method will return the best <code>Organism</code> the NEAT algorithm found.
<br><br>
You can also resume a previous evolution process from where it last checkpointed by using the <code>Evolver.loadFromPersistence()</code>
factory method. This requires the use of a seperate <code>Persistence</code> instance than the one provided
in <code>SimpleNeatParameters</code>, as the default <code>Persistence</code> instance is a NO-OP (i.e. it does nothing). Alternative
<code>Persistence</code> implementations are:
<ul>
	<li> XStream (XML) - </li>
	<li> Hibernate (Database) - </li>
	<li> Java Object Serialization (Binary; same as Neuroph) - </li>  
</ul>




<br><br>
To convert the best organism back into a <code>NeuralNetwork</code> you can simply use the <code>NeuralNetworkBuilder</code>
you provided in the <code>NeatParameters</code> instance.

<code>
<pre>
		NeatParameters params = ....
		// other code ommitted.
		
		Organism best = evolver.evolve();
		org.neuroph.core.NeuralNetwork nn = params.getNeuralNetworkBuilder().createNeuralNetwork(best);
</pre>
</code>
<br>You now have a <code>org.neuroph.core.NeuralNetwork</code> to do whatever you would like with.
